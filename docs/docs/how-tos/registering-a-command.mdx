# Creating A Command

Dapper Go commands contain three parts. The Discord command, any command options such as whether the command should be ephemeral or not and a handler function. When a command is registered Dapper Go routes incoming command interactions to that handler function.

## Defining A Command

To define a command, the `dapper.DapperCommand{}` structure should be used.

```go
var my_command = dapper.DapperCommand{
	Command: client.CreateApplicationCommand{
		Name:        "my-command",
		Description: helpers.Ptr("An example Dapper Go Command"),
	},
	CommandOptions: dapper.DapperCommandOptions{
		Ephemeral: true,
	},
	OnCommand: func (itx *discord.Interaction) {
		err := itx.EditResponse(discord.ResponseEditData{
			Content: helpers.Ptr("Hello World!")
		})

		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("failed to send edit response")
		}
	},
}
```

## Registering A Command

Once you have defined a command, you need to register the command with the interaction server. To do this, use the `RegisterCommand()` function providing a `dapper.DapperCommand{}` structure as the argument.

```go
func main() {
	interactionServer := server.NewInteractionServer("You should put your discord public key here")

	interactionServer.RegisterCommand(my_command)

	interactionServer.Listen(3000)
}
```

## Registering A Command With Discord

Dapper doesn't automatically register commands with Discord. You must further use the `RegisterCommandsWithDiscord()` function, providing your application id and a bot client instance. See the bot client page for more details on this.


```go
func main() {
	interactionServer := server.NewInteractionServer("You should put your discord public key here")
	botClient := client.NewBot("Your bot token here")

	appId, err := discord.GetSnowflake(os.Getenv("Your app id here"))

	interactionServer.RegisterCommand(my_command)

	botServer.RegisterCommandsWithDiscord(appId, botClient)

	interactionServer.Listen(3000)
}
```
